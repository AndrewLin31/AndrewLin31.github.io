							<p>Hello! I'm Andrew,</p>
							<p>
								I have experience in prototyping self-made devices, 3d printing, and circuit design. Outside of these hands-on skills, 
								I also know how to program! Most of my projects involve embedded systems software where I develop programs along with
							 a device in order to perform tasks such as data analysis and interacting with users. Things I have also dabbled in involve
							  game design and bot development where I had to learn a lot about user experience.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of my passions is to be involved with developing projects that yield positive results for the end-users. While interning at ENDEAVR,
							 I learned a lot about data collecting and user feedback outside of new technologies. A revelation I had while working on an official project
							  was that, with my work, peopleâ€™s lives can be positively impacted. And although it was a small project, the impact it had was immensely fulfilling.
							</p>

							<p>
								Outside of my experiences in coding, I love to draw, paint, cook Chinese food, socialize, and make new friends. Although I would label myself as an introvert, I am willing to step out of 
								my comfort zone if it meant I ended up with a new friend. I also have the tendency to geek out on certain topics such as PC gaming, digital art, and recent shows/movies
								 that I have watched (e.g Everything Everywhere All at Once, Arcane, Aggretsuko ).
